Hangman

Introduction \n
As a first task for the BeCode training in group Bouman 3.31, I created this Hangman game. 
It is the first time that I did something more elaborate than write some simple functions, 
so the outcome is not completely structured as asked, but the game works like a charm.

The game \n
The player gets a series of underscores, each representing a letter that has to be guessed. 
For every wrongly guessed letter, the player loses one of their initial five lives. When
the lives are spent, the game is over. If the word is guessed, the player wins.\n
\n
After every turn, the player is kept up-to-date about their number of lives, the number of
mistakes they made and the number of turns they have used. The wrongly guessed numbers are
also displayed.
